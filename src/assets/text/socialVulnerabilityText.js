    title: "How we think about social vulnerability matters",
    paragraph1: "There are two main ways to frame social vulnerability. In one framing, we understand social vulnerability as an outcome of events produced by external stressors (for example, exposure and socioeconomic status). In another framing, we view social vulnerability as a preexisting condition from which water insecurity arises as an outcome of unequal social conditions (for example, health, perception of water-related risk, and living conditions). Which frame we choose affects which determinants and locations we invest time and resources in studying.",
    paragraph2: "In general, studies have approached social vulnerability more commonly as a product of external stressors rather than a preexisting condition for water insecurity. In other words, they’ve focused more on where water insecurity happens than who experiences it and why. This focus has the potential to misdirect well-intentioned decision makers. For example, the SED-IIDD team found that exposure to external stressors was one of the most frequently measured dimensions in the scientific literature. Of the 8 determinants of exposure assessed, however, only hazard extent had high levels of agreement among studies. That is to say, exposure may be studied a lot, but there isn’t much agreement on which elements of exposure are the most important predictors of social vulnerability to water insecurity.",
    paragraph3: "There is a lot of uncertainty around other potentially important social factors for water insecurity. For example, disability status has been found to be strongly associated with water insecurity but has only been assessed by two studies in our sample. Similarly, multiple health indicators, like sanitation and life expectancy, appear to have strong relationships with water insecurity but have only been measured by a single study."
