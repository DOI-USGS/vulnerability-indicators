    paragraph2: "Who we are and where we live affect our access to clean, plentiful water. Certain categories of social factors (called “dimensions”) make us more vulnerable to water insecurity. These dimensions—demographic characteristics, living conditions, socioeconomic status, and exposure to external stressors like drought or pollution—have been studied by many researchers, most of whom agree the dimensions affect water insecurity. But certain aspects of those dimensions of social vulnerability (called “determinants”) are better studied than others. How much do we know about the effects of these determinants on water insecurity? Which determinants are we confident about, and which do we need to understand better? The Socioeconomic Drivers Program of the USGS Water Resources Mission Area is working to find out. "
