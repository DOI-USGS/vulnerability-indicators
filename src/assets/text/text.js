      title: "Social vulnerabilities in agricultural versus municipal sectors",
      paragraph1: "Agricultural and municipal water use are the two largest water-use sectors in the western United States. Studies of social vulnerability to water insecurity in these two sectors tend to focus on different determinants. For the agricultural sector, studies have mostly looked at exposure to external stressors (where water insecurity is happening) and living conditions. On the other hand, studies of the municipal sector have focused on demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status. Many studies of the municipal sector have emphasized exposure, as well. Because of the different focuses of these studies, we understand the influence of determinants like demographics and socioeconomics better in the municipal sector than we do in the agricultural sector. Which brings us to an important point…"

      paragraph2: "Who we are and where we live affect our access to clean, plentiful water. Certain categories of social factors (called “dimensions”) make us more vulnerable to water insecurity. These dimensions—demographic characteristics, living conditions, socioeconomic status, and exposure to external stressors like drought or pollution—have been studied by many researchers, most of whom agree the dimensions affect water insecurity. But certain aspects of those dimensions of social vulnerability (called “determinants”) are better studied than others. How much do we know about the effects of these determinants on water insecurity? Which determinants are we confident about, and which do we need to understand better? The Socioeconomic Drivers Program of the USGS Water Resources Mission Area is working to find out. "

      title: "Demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status across the Western states ",
      paragraph1: "Factors associated with social vulnerability to water insecurity are not equally distributed across the Western United States. Certain races and ethnicities are more heavily concentrated in some geographic areas than in others. Similarly, some counties have much higher median household incomes than other counties do. Understanding where these vulnerable populations live is important information for water-resource managers to make equitable decisions about water availability and use."

      paragraph1: "Line thickness = how much evidence do we have that the determinant or indicator contributes to water insecurity ",
      paragraph2: "In 2023, the USGS Social and Economic Drivers Program (SED, for short) and partners in the USGS Integrated Information Dissemination Division (IIDD) conducted a meta-analysis of studies that measured factors of social vulnerability associated with conditions of water insecurity. A meta-analysis is a type of review study, where researchers combine data from many different studies to try to identify bigger patterns across all the results. The team focused their analysis on studies published between 2000 and 2022 that took place in the conterminous United States (lower 48 states) west of the Mississippi River. The Western states face a slew of water availability challenges, including increasing population growth, dependence on groundwater, and generally low precipitation (see <a href='https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/2005/circ1261/pdf/C1261.pdf' target='_blank'>Anderson and Woosley 2005</a> for a discussion of water availability in the Western United States). But not all populations across the West  experience the same levels of water insecurity.",
      paragraph3: "“The goal of our meta-analysis was to provide baseline metrics supporting the development of a set of indicators describing social vulnerability of key water-use sectors (agricultural and municipal) to conditions of water insecurity,” explains Oronde Drakes, social geographer and lead author of the meta-analysis. “This includes understanding the inherent vulnerabilities of populations dependent on these water-use sectors as well as those decision-making processes that can exacerbate vulnerabilities.”",
      paragraph4: "What the SED-IIDD team found was that a small subset of social vulnerability indicators was not only studied a lot but was consistently associated with water insecurity. Multiple demographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, family structure, gender, and language proficiency), dependence on specific sources and uses of water, wealth, and exposure to water-related hazards all had large amounts of evidence and high levels of agreement for their influence on water insecurity."

      title: "How we think about social vulnerability matters",
      paragraph1: "There are two main ways to frame social vulnerability. In one framing, we understand social vulnerability as an outcome of events produced by external stressors (for example, exposure and socioeconomic status). In another framing, we view social vulnerability as a preexisting condition from which water insecurity arises as an outcome of unequal social conditions (for example, health, perception of water-related risk, and living conditions). Which frame we choose affects which determinants and locations we invest time and resources in studying.",
      paragraph2: "In general, studies have approached social vulnerability more commonly as a product of external stressors rather than a preexisting condition for water insecurity. In other words, they’ve focused more on where water insecurity happens than who experiences it and why. This focus has the potential to misdirect well-intentioned decision makers. For example, the SED-IIDD team found that exposure to external stressors was one of the most frequently measured dimensions in the scientific literature. Of the 8 determinants of exposure assessed, however, only hazard extent had high levels of agreement among studies. That is to say, exposure may be studied a lot, but there isn’t much agreement on which elements of exposure are the most important predictors of social vulnerability to water insecurity.",
      paragraph3: "There is a lot of uncertainty around other potentially important social factors for water insecurity. For example, disability status has been found to be strongly associated with water insecurity but has only been assessed by two studies in our sample. Similarly, multiple health indicators, like sanitation and life expectancy, appear to have strong relationships with water insecurity but have only been measured by a single study."
