    title: "Meta-analysis of social vulnerability to water insecurity ",
    paragraph1: "Line thickness = how much evidence do we have that the determinant or indicator contributes to water insecurity ",
    paragraph2: "In 2023, the USGS Social and Economic Drivers Program (SED, for short) and partners in the USGS Integrated Information Dissemination Division (IIDD) conducted a meta-analysis of studies that measured factors of social vulnerability associated with conditions of water insecurity. A meta-analysis is a type of review study, where researchers combine data from many different studies to try to identify bigger patterns across all the results. The team focused their analysis on studies published between 2000 and 2022 that took place in the conterminous United States (lower 48 states) west of the Mississippi River <a href='https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/63f79d49d34e4f7eda456572' target='_blank'>(Hines and others 2023)</a>. The Western states face a slew of water availability challenges, including increasing population growth, dependence on groundwater, and generally low precipitation (see <a href='https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/2005/circ1261/pdf/C1261.pdf' target='_blank'>Anderson and Woosley 2005</a> for a discussion of water availability in the Western United States). But not all populations across the West  experience the same levels of water insecurity.",
    paragraph3: "“The goal of our meta-analysis was to provide baseline metrics supporting the development of a set of indicators describing social vulnerability of key water-use sectors (agricultural and municipal) to conditions of water insecurity,” explains Oronde Drakes, social geographer and lead author of the meta-analysis. “This includes understanding the inherent vulnerabilities of populations dependent on these water-use sectors as well as those decision-making processes that can exacerbate vulnerabilities.”",
    paragraph4: "What the SED-IIDD team found was that a small subset of social vulnerability indicators was not only studied a lot but was consistently associated with water insecurity. Multiple demographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, family structure, gender, and language proficiency), dependence on specific sources and uses of water, wealth, and exposure to water-related hazards all had large amounts of evidence and high levels of agreement for their influence on water insecurity."
