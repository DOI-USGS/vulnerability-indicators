    paragraph1: "Factors associated with social vulnerability to water insecurity are not equally distributed across the Western United States. Certain races and ethnicities are more heavily concentrated in some geographic areas than in others. Similarly, some counties have much higher median household incomes than other counties do. Understanding where these vulnerable populations live is important information for water-resource managers to make equitable decisions about water availability and use."
