# vulnerability-indicators
This repo uses R, Vue, and D3 to build an interactive data visualization website about indicators of vulnerability to water insecurity. In R there is a pipeline that uses the `targets` library to fetch, process, and visualize data. The rest of the files build the website. It is currently in active development.

## Running the targets pipeline in R
Clone the repo. In RStudio, run `library(targets)` and `tar_make()`. This will require ScienceBase credentials to run, see instructions below.

## Building the website locally
 Clone the repo. In the directory, run `npm install` to install the required modules. Once the dependencies have been installed, run `npm run dev` to run locally from your browser.
 
 To build the website locally you'll need `npm v20` and `node v8.1` or higher installed. To manage multiple versions of `npm`, you may [try using `nvm`](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-change-node-js-version-between-projects-using-nvm-3ad2416bda7e).

Once the dependencies have been installed, run `npm run serve` to run locally from your browser.

## Deploying the website
