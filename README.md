# vulnerability-indicators

This repo uses R, Vue, and D3 to build an interactive data visualization website about indicators of vulnerability to water insecurity. In R there is a pipeline that uses the `targets` library to fetch, process, and visualize data. The rest of the files build the website. It is currently in active development.

## Running the targets pipeline in R

Clone the repo. In RStudio, run `library(targets)` and `tar_make()`. This will require ScienceBase credentials and `tidycensus` credentialing to run, see instructions below.

## `tidycensus`set up

Adapted from package developers [Kyle Walker & Matt Herman](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html), to set up `tidycensus` run the following in the R Console:

```         
# install.packages("tidycensus")
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
```

You will also need to set a Census API key. A key can be obtained from <http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html>.

```         
census_api_key("YOUR API KEY GOES HERE", install = TRUE)
readRenviron("~/.Renviron")
```

## Building the website locally

Clone the repo. In the directory, run `npm install` to install the required modules. Once the dependencies have been installed, run `npm run dev` to run locally from your browser.

To build the website locally you'll need `npm v20` and `node v8.1` or higher installed. To manage multiple versions of `npm`, you may [try using `nvm`](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-change-node-js-version-between-projects-using-nvm-3ad2416bda7e).

## Deploying the website
